# `ramond` Blender Plugin

The raymond Blender exporter enables users to export scenes from Blender in a JSON format compatible with raymond.
Based on Ã–mercan Yazici's [Ignis Export Plugin](https://github.com/PearCoding/Ignis/tree/master/scripts/blender_exporter), which in turn was based on Pascal Grittmann's [SeeSharp Export Plugin](https://github.com/pgrit/SeeSharp).
